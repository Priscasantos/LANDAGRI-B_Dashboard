# Chart Implementation Improvements - TODO List

## Dashboard Status Update

**CRITICAL ERRORS RESOLVED - DASHBOARD OPERATIONAL** âœ…

All IndentationError issues have been systematically fixed across all dashboard modules:
- `temporal.py`: Fixed 6 incomplete if blocks (lines 294, 440, 650, 809, 828, 873)
- `detailed.py`: Fixed 6 incomplete if blocks (lines 314, 376, 408, 496, 567, 646)  
- `conab.py`: Complete implementation with run() function created from scratch
- Dashboard successfully running on http://localhost:8502

All syntax errors have been resolved. The dashboard is now fully operational and ready for continued chart modernization work.
