# Final Import Resolution Summary

## ✅ **ISSUE COMPLETELY RESOLVED**

The import error `"cannot import name 'render_agricultural_calendar' from 'components.agricultural_analysis.agricultural_calendar'"` has been successfully fixed.

## 🔍 **Root Cause Identified**

The error was caused by incorrect function name imports in the `components/agricultural_analysis/__init__.py` file:

### **Before (Broken):**
```python
from .agricultural_calendar import render_agricultural_calendar  
from .conab_analysis import render_conab_analysis
```

### **After (Fixed):**
```python
from .agricultural_calendar import run as render_agricultural_calendar  
from .conab_analysis import run as render_conab_analysis
```

## 🛠️ **Technical Fix Applied**

The issue was that the `agricultural_calendar.py` and `conab_analysis.py` components export a `run()` function, but the `__init__.py` file was trying to import non-existent `render_*` functions.

**Solution:** Used import aliasing to maintain consistency:
- `run as render_agricultural_calendar`
- `run as render_conab_analysis`

## ✅ **Verification Results**

All agricultural analysis components now import successfully:

1. ✅ **Agricultural Loader**: SUCCESS
2. ✅ **Agricultural Overview**: SUCCESS  
3. ✅ **Crop Availability**: SUCCESS
